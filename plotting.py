What do we want to show with the plots?
- How the genetic algorithm evolves over time

- What do the filtered trajectories look like for each in the population?
  - Compare these to the ground truth and the best seen
- How do the valuues in the population evolve over time
  - Similarly, want to highlight the best one so far and how this changes
- Convergence plot for mahalanobis distance metric evaluations
