Questions for Mac

Having trouble with:
- Determining a good objective function - and how can we probe this objective function?
- Figuring out how to evaluate performance without access to the ground truth data - originally thinking I could just find the result that minimizes oscillation or bias but this is much more difficult than I thought
- Just formulating the problems in general
- Dealing with different notations in the reference papers
- Trying to do something different that isn't just a standard filter we've already done


Questions:
- Recommendations for line search with EKF without just repeating the iEKF? It usually requires a step direction, but this seems like it doesn't make a whole lot of sense given what we already know about the system and the jacobians?

Ask about:
- Genetic algorithms with KF? - A would need to be a constant matrix with no dependence on x or t
- Recommendations for linear systems with more parameters/DOFs?
